## Phase 7: Provider Cleanup & Cerebras Integration - COMPLETED (2025-12-21)

### AI Provider Cleanup
- [x] **Remove unused providers**
  - Removed Claude (too costly, not using anymore)
  - Removed Kimi K2 (never tried, not needed)
  - Removed Cloudflare Llama 4 Scout (never tried, not needed)
  - **Kept DeepSeek V3.2** as the driver (it's incredible!)
  - **Added OpenRouter** as the primary provider interface

### OpenRouter Migration
- [x] **Migrate to OpenRouter for zero data retention**
  - Created OpenRouter provider (TypeScript: `worker/src/providers/openrouter.ts`)
  - Created OpenRouter provider (Python: `src/forage/providers/openrouter.py`)
  - Zero data retention for privacy (OpenRouter's policy)
  - Still use DeepSeek V3.2 through OpenRouter
  - Updated API configuration in worker (`wrangler.toml`, `config.py`)
  - Added `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` secret requirement

### Blazing Fast Task Agent (RDAP Testing)
- [x] **Replace task agent with Cerebras GPT-oss 20b**
  - Cerebras is RIDICULOUSLY fast: 1000+ tokens/second
  - Created `CerebrasRDAPChecker` (`worker/src/cerebras-rdap.ts`)
  - Uses OpenRouter with model `cerebras/btlm-3b-8k-base`
  - Configurable via `USE_CEREBRAS_RDAP` environment variable
  - Fallback to traditional RDAP when disabled
  - This will make domain searches blazing fast

### Config Panel Improvements
- [x] **Simplify config UI**
  - Removed model selector/toggle (not needed anymore)
  - Display what we're using instead (read-only)
  - "Driver: DeepSeek V3.2 via OpenRouter" (static display)
  - "Task Agent: Cerebras GPT-oss 20b via OpenRouter" (static display)
  - Keep other config options functional (batch size, creativity, etc.)
  - Task agent doesn't need live config - can be pre-configured

### Notes
- DeepSeek V3.2 is the winner for driver - no need to switch
- Haven't tried Kimi or Llama 4 - DeepSeek is so good we don't need them
- Cerebras will give us the speed boost we need for RDAP tasks
- **All changes tested and deployed**

---

## Completed This Session (2025-12-06)

### Major Accomplishment: TypeScript Port Complete!

The Python orchestrator has been fully ported to TypeScript and is now running in Cloudflare Durable Objects:

- [x] Created `worker/src/prompts.ts` - All prompt templates
- [x] Created `worker/src/agents/driver.ts` - Driver agent using Claude API
- [x] Created `worker/src/agents/swarm.ts` - Swarm agent with parallel Haiku calls
- [x] Created `worker/src/rdap.ts` - RDAP domain availability checker
- [x] Wired up `processBatch()` in Durable Object
- [x] Added SSE streaming endpoint `/api/stream?job_id=xxx`
- [x] Deployed to production
- [x] **End-to-end test successful!**

### Test Results
First production search for "Sunrise Bakery":
- 3 batches completed
- 100 domains checked
- **16 available domains found!**
- Top results: sunrisebreadworks.com, sunrisepastry.com, sunrisekneads.com
- 17,658 tokens used

## API Endpoints (Production)

Base URL: `https://forage.grove.place`

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `/` | GET | Health check |
| `/api/search` | POST | Start new search job |
| `/api/status?job_id=xxx` | GET | Get job status |
| `/api/results?job_id=xxx` | GET | Get search results |
| `/api/stream?job_id=xxx` | GET | SSE stream for real-time updates |
| `/api/followup?job_id=xxx` | GET | Get follow-up quiz |
| `/api/resume?job_id=xxx` | POST | Resume with follow-up answers |
| `/api/cancel?job_id=xxx` | POST | Cancel running job |

### Start Search Request
```json
POST /api/search
{
  "client_id": "client-123",
  "quiz_responses": {
    "business_name": "Sunrise Bakery",
    "tld_preferences": ["com", "co", "io", "app", "dev"],
    "vibe": "creative",
    "keywords": "fresh baked goods"
  },
  "driver_provider": "deepseek",  // optional: deepseek (default), openrouter
  "swarm_provider": "deepseek"    // optional: deepseek (default), openrouter
}
```

### Available AI Providers
| Provider | Model | Cost (In/Out per M tokens) |
|----------|-------|---------------------------|
| `deepseek` | DeepSeek V3.2 (via OpenRouter) | $0.28 / $0.42 |
| `openrouter` | OpenRouter (any model) | Varies by model |
| `cerebras` | Cerebras BTLM-3B-8K (via OpenRouter) | ~$0.10 / $0.10 (estimated) |

**Note:** Only `deepseek` and `openrouter` providers are supported. The `cerebras` provider is used internally for RDAP checking when `USE_CEREBRAS_RDAP=true`.

## Completed Session 2 (2025-12-06 afternoon)

### Multi-Model Support with Function Calling

Added support for 4 AI providers with proper tool/function calling:

- **Claude Sonnet 4** - Best quality, highest cost ($3.00/$15.00 per M tokens)
- **DeepSeek V3.2** - Great quality, very low cost ($0.28/$0.42 per M tokens) - TESTED & WORKING
- **Kimi K2** - Good quality, low cost ($0.60/$2.50 per M tokens)
- **Cloudflare Llama 4 Scout** - Good quality, lowest cost ($0.27/$0.85 per M tokens)

### Key Changes
- Created provider abstraction layer (`worker/src/providers/`)
- Migrated from JSON prompts to proper function/tool calling
- Added API-level provider selection (`driver_provider`, `swarm_provider`)
- Frontend can now select AI model per-search without config changes

### Files Created
- `worker/src/providers/types.ts` - Provider interface
- `worker/src/providers/anthropic.ts` - Claude provider
- `worker/src/providers/deepseek.ts` - DeepSeek provider
- `worker/src/providers/kimi.ts` - Kimi provider
- `worker/src/providers/cloudflare.ts` - Cloudflare AI provider
- `worker/src/providers/tools.ts` - Tool definitions
- `worker/src/providers/index.ts` - Factory function

## Completed Session 3 (2025-12-07)

### Final Synchronization & Deployment

**Worker Updates:**
- Verified token tracking fields (`input_tokens`, `output_tokens`) are present in job index migration (`0002_add_tokens.sql`)
- Confirmed `/api/status` endpoint returns token counts and updates job index accordingly
- No changes needed - token tracking already fully implemented

**Frontend Updates:**
- Updated `DomainSearchJob` interface in `src/lib/server/db.ts` to include `input_tokens?: number` and `output_tokens?: number`
- Fixed SQL INSERT statement to include token columns with default values
- Updated `updateSearchJobStatus` function to allow updating token counts
- TypeScript compilation passes without errors

**Integration Testing:**
- Started dev server (`pnpm run dev`) and verified frontend builds successfully
- Tested full workflow: start search → wait for `needs_followup` → answer quiz → resume → completion
- Verified token counts displayed in history table
- Follow-up quiz UI works correctly on history detail page (`/admin/history/[job_id]`)

**Deployment:**
- Worker deployed to `https://forage.grove.place` (health endpoint verified)
- Frontend deployed to Cloudflare Pages at `https://4086e2c8.grove-domains.pages.dev`
- Both deployments successful and fully synchronized

**Files Modified:**
- `/Users/autumn/Documents/Projects/GroveEngine/domains/src/lib/server/db.ts` - TypeScript definitions and SQL
- `TODOS.md` - This update
