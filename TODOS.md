## Next Steps (Priority Order)

### 1. Real-Time Progress Streaming (for domains.grove.place)
The website needs to show live progress as the search runs. Implementation plan:
- Add SSE endpoint to Durable Object: `GET /job/{id}/stream`
- Stream events: `batch_start`, `batch_complete`, `domain_found`, `search_complete`
- Include usage stats in stream events
- Client subscribes to SSE and updates UI in real-time

### 2. Wire Up DO to Python Orchestrator
Currently the DO has placeholder logic. Need to:
- Make DO call the Python orchestrator (or port orchestrator to TypeScript)
- Alternative: DO calls external API endpoint that runs Python orchestrator
- Ensure state persistence between alarm-triggered batches

### 3. Test Full End-to-End Flow
- Submit quiz via API
- DO starts search job
- Progress streams to website
- Results displayed when complete

### 4. Production Deployment
- Deploy to production environment (not just dev)
- Set production secrets
- Configure custom domain if needed
